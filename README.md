# ChatServer_Node_Socket
This is an integrated dashboard and chat application.
Idea of the application is that it can be used during Business Go-live events. It provides a single page dashboard which would provide real time data (refreshed using ajax calls every 5 seconds). It leverages REST endpoints for these ajax calls. As REST is agnostic to the teechnology, application teams can use REST api from any language (Node.js, Java, PHP etc.) in this application and can read of a vast number of resources (SQL, NoSQL db etc.).
In the current example, this app reads of a REST end point hosted on a different server (refer to https://github.com/vvijay26/NodejsREST for more details)
